{the key}
{your synthesizer}
{This is the synthesizer Reverse Biaz wants you to play.}
{the music stands}
{You see a bunch of music stands. Or is it a flock of music stands? Or is it a bevy of music stands? You always forget.}
{the control room}
{From his control room, Reverse can see the entire studio. He can speak to you through the soundproof glass via a talkback loudspeaker.}
{the overhead mike}
{You wonder how many evil recordings were done with this microphone.}
{the drum set}
{As in most studios, the drum set is behind glass to enhance the separation of his sound from the other musicians.}

{des Rever Records spared no expense programming this synthesizer for this session.}
{the control room mixer}
{the studio control panel}
