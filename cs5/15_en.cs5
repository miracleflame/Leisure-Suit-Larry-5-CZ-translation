^If you're having a good time playing this game and would like to order other fun products from the Sierra family of computer games, just give our Order Desk a telephone call at
%s.
(International customers call %s.)

Our friendly and courteous order takers are probably sitting around doing nothing right now and would love to have someone to talk to!

^You'll also want to order spare copies of all these
other lovable Larry Laffer mis-adventures:
"Leisure Suit Larry In the Land of the Lounge Lizards,"
"Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love
(in Several Wrong Places),"
"Leisure Suit Larry 3: Passionate Patti
in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals,"
"Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies," and
"The Laffer Utilities," a collection of silly little programs designed just for fun at the office.

(Well, maybe you shouldn't order your copies of Larry4 just yet; we seem to have misplaced our master disks.)

^Besides the Larry series, Al Lowe has written these other fine Sierra games: "Bop-A-Bet,"
"Dragon's Keep," "Troll's Tale,"
"The Gelfling Adventure," "The Black Cauldron,"
"Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Woods,"
and "Donald Duck's Playground."
